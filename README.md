In the following assignment, you are required to implement a simple Micro-Service
framework, which you will then use to implement a system for managing the University
compute resources.

The Micro-Services architecture has become quite popular in recent years. In the
Micro-Services architecture, complex applications are composed of small and independent
services which are able to communicate with each other using messages. The
Micro-Service architecture allows us to compose a large program from a collection of
smaller independent parts.

This assignment is composed of two main sections:
1. Building a simple Micro-Service framework.
2. Implementing a system for managing the university computer resources on top of
this framework.
